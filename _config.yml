  Motivated entry level software engineer excited to begin applying the knowledge 
  and skills I have gained in my studies to real world application. I enjoy 
  finding creative solutions to tough problems, creating new programs, 
  and optimizing existing programs. I am a quick learner, action oriented and strategic thinker.
